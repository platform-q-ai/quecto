# Swarm workbench

`swarm` replaces `python_lab`. It is a compiled native tool using the existing
isolated Python execution, output artifacts, resource limits and cancellation
machinery. There is one tool surface. Existing `tools.python_lab` limits remain
accepted as a configuration alias for `tools.swarm`; serialization uses the new
name. Update tool policy names and saved prompts to `swarm`. Supplying both
configuration keys is an error rather than silently choosing one.

## Container and membership

Use the existing `spawn` container capability with the official Docker/Podman
adapter. The adapter passes the shared checkout and runtime identity to every
in-container harness process. Host-local reference scripts do not confer swarm
availability. The harness rejects `swarm` outside that context, even if someone
plants a coordination file in the host checkout. Linux procfs supplies process
start identities for conservative lifecycle reconciliation.

The first in-container agent is the coordinator and designated Git integrator.
The external supervising parent is not a member. Initial harness startup records
membership in a setup board; creation cannot choose a smaller limit than the
already live/reserved population. Create the run before launching the pool.

Call `swarm` with `op=create`, a nonempty `goal`, a list of `constraints`,
`criteria`, `member_limit` (1 through 10), and `deadline` (Unix seconds, in the
future and no more than seven days away). Each criterion has an `id`, a
`description`, and `kind` of `command` or `review`. For example:

```json
[
  {"id":"acceptance","kind":"command","description":"Acceptance tests pass at the submitted commit"},
  {"id":"review","kind":"review","description":"Independent reviewer accepts the submitted commit"}
]
```

The coordinator counts toward the limit, including with a one-member pool.
Use existing local `spawn` inside the container to establish the fixed pool.
External parents may use existing container joins; startup performs the same
atomic admission. Idle members count. Changing the session name, switching
entrypoints, or spawning descendants does not establish a new run budget.
Nested container launches are rejected. An existing run cannot be reset through
the helper API. This bounds harness-managed agents, not arbitrary subprocesses
or direct provider API calls. Provider inference admission is separate (#1679).

Launch reservations precede process launch. Failed launches release reservations
when no process was started or termination was confirmed. Launched processes are
identified by PID and kernel start time, avoiding accidental reuse of a recycled
PID. `op=reconcile` updates confirmed deaths. Neither a worker's completion
message nor elapsed time frees its slot. Unknown lifecycle state retains capacity
and reports an error; resolve it using existing lifecycle controls.

## Packaged API

Each `op=run` starts a fresh `python3 -I` process. The harness loads compiled-in
helper sources directly and binds the invoking member; neither `PYTHONPATH` nor
an importable file in the checkout controls the helper. Python variables do not
persist. The SQLite database at `.quecto/swarm.sqlite` does.

```python
from swarm import board

summary = board.summary()
task = board.task_create("implement-v1", "Implement the behavior", ["Acceptance tests pass"], [])
claim = board.claim(task["id"])
files = board.reserve(task["id"], claim["token"], ["src/feature.rs", "tests/feature.rs"])
# Use existing tools to implement and test. Store large output as artifacts.
board.submit(task["id"], claim["token"], [
    {"artifact": "evidence/acceptance.log", "revision": "the-exact-commit-or-artifact-digest"}
])
```

`task(id)` reads a task. `dependencies(id, ids)` edits dependencies before
claiming; missing, self and cyclic dependencies fail. Ready tasks are claimed
atomically. Unmet dependencies and explicit `block(id, token, reason)` remain
visible as blockers. `release(id, token)` returns owned work and files to the
board. A fresh claim has a new token; stale tokens cannot submit, release or
complete reassigned work. `task_create` and `send` use request IDs for retry
idempotency; reusing an ID with a different payload is an error. Identical
submission and verification retries do not repeat their transitions.

File sets are reserved all at once or not at all. Paths resolve inside the shared
checkout, including symlink aliases and not-yet-created files.
`release_files(task_id, claim_token, reservation_token)` cannot remove a newer
owner's reservation. Only the coordinator may `recover(task_id)`, after the
harness has confirmed that its owner died. There are no expiring ownership leases.

These are **cooperative reservations**, not mandatory locks: Bash and arbitrary
Python can bypass them. The container is the external containment boundary,
not a security boundary between same-user workers. Do not construct a different
`Workbench`, call underscore lifecycle methods, edit SQLite, or bypass file
ownership. Only the designated integrator changes branches, commits, or integrates
changes in the shared checkout. Concurrent Git merge automation is not provided.

## Messages and waking

Use stable member IDs from `summary()["members"]`:

```python
board.send("schema-question-v1", recipient_id, "Blocked: which schema version should I use?")
for message in board.inbox():
    print(message)
    board.ack(message["id"])
```

Messages are `accepted` when durable and `consumed` when acknowledged. Neither
means work completed. `inbox(include_consumed=True)` also reads consumed history.
Messages are at most 8192 UTF-8 bytes; each inbox admits at most 100 unconsumed
messages. Unknown/dead recipients and full inboxes fail explicitly. The board
bounds tasks to 1000 and request-ledger entries to 10000 per run. Store large data
in artifacts, not task or message text.

After mutations the harness uses existing UDS prompt/follow-up capabilities for
wake hints. Read-only executions do not generate hints. Failed hints are returned
as `notification_warnings`; accepted SQLite records remain recoverable. When no
work is ready, yield the turn. Do not poll, repeatedly sleep, or infer completion
from an empty ready queue.

## Verification, stopping and progress

Workers submit evidence references. Only the coordinator can verify submitted
tasks with `verify_task(id, claim_token, revision)`, accept evidence using
`evidence(criterion, artifact, revision, kind, passed)`, and `complete(revision)`.
A worker's `evidence` call records an unaccepted submission. A coordinator must
actually inspect command results and obtain the required independent/human
review before accepting them; the helper does not execute tests or act as an
independent reviewer. `command` and `review` evidence are distinguished.

Completion requires accepted evidence for every original criterion at the
specified revision, completed tasks with matching evidence revisions, and no
remaining file reservations. Submitted tasks, idle agents and an empty queue do
not prove success. `amend(goal, constraints, criteria, reason)` is coordinator-only,
records the amendment, and invalidates prior overall evidence.

`op=summary` reports goal, status, membership usage/limit, task counts and details,
blockers, file owners, evidence and recent actor/timestamp audit events. The full
audit remains in SQLite. `stop(status, reason)` distinguishes `blocked`, `failed`,
`cancelled`, and `budget-exhausted`; success is `succeeded`. `op=cancel_run` is the
parent cancellation operation. New work and admission stop at terminal state;
existing harness abort/process cleanup settles workers and reconciliation preserves
readable partial progress. Keep the coordinator available to report to the parent.

The required run budget is wall-clock time. A harness timer supervises the deadline
even when agents are idle, and Python execution timeouts cannot exceed the remaining
run time (one-second timeout granularity). No turn or token hard caps are promised.
The helper holds no SQLite transaction across model/tool execution or lifecycle
notifications. SQLite uses short immediate transactions and a bounded contention
timeout, on a suitable **local filesystem** only. Corrupt, missing or locked state
fails explicitly; it never creates a replacement board or bypasses admission.

Execution artifacts remain under `.quecto/swarm/<execution_id>/` with the existing
32-directory pruning policy. The sibling `.quecto/swarm.sqlite` database is never
pruned with those artifacts. Container destruction remains destructive unless the
user preserves its storage; cross-container recovery is not provided.
